# 06_Zuber_TaxiEDA_vFinal

## About this Project

The hypothetical company Zuber gathers taxi ride information to a database, sampled outside this project. This EDA project explores trends in taxi rides for Chicago in November 2017 and tests a hypothesis about the affect of rain on the taxi activity.

The project shows, first and foremost, how to clean and organize SQL-sampled data. It also demonstrates scipy's hypothesis testing libraries for theories data scientists may have about various aspects of their dataset.

## Running it Yourself

The Jupyter notebook is self-contained and reflects the outputs of the code contained within. If you would like to connect to your own environment and run the notebook, or make changes on your own fork of the repo, you may do so after cloning. Make sure the environment is either based in the upper-level folder to which you clone the repo, or be sure to replace the dataset file references with a direct local reference to the /datasets/ folder on your machine. 

The project uses plotly 5.24.1 which requires nbformat package to be at least 4.2.0. Check your ipykernal to make sure it is up to date. It also relies on scipy 1.14. The project is stable with Python 3.11.
